Python OOP Assignments:
This repository contains a series of Python assignments designed to explore and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each assignment covers a different aspect of Python classes, including inheritance, decorators, abstract classes, instance and class methods, static methods, and more.

Assignments Overview
Here is a list of the assignments included in this repository:

1.Using self
Demonstrates the use of self keyword to initialize instance variables and create a simple class.

2.Using cls
Illustrates how to use the cls keyword in class methods to manage class variables.

3.Public Variables and Methods
Shows how to use public variables and methods in a class and access them from outside the class.

4.Class Variables and Class Methods
Focuses on creating and modifying class variables using class methods.

5.Static Variables and Static Methods
Demonstrates the use of static methods, which do not require instance or class variables.

6.Constructors and Destructors
Explains the concept of constructors and destructors, including object creation and destruction.

7.Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected
Introduces the concept of access modifiers and their use in Python classes.

8.The super() Function
Demonstrates how to use super() to call base class methods in an inherited class.

9.Abstract Classes and Methods
Shows how to use the abc module to create abstract classes and methods.

10.Instance Methods
Demonstrates how to define and use instance methods that operate on instance variables.

11.Class Methods
Focuses on defining class methods that operate on class variables.

12.Static Methods
Explains static methods that do not depend on instance or class variables.

13.Composition
Demonstrates composition, where one class is used as a member of another class.

14.Aggregation
Illustrates aggregation, where a class holds a reference to another class.

15.Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
Explores the method resolution order (MRO) and diamond inheritance pattern.

16.Function Decorators
Introduces function decorators, which are used to modify the behavior of functions.

17.Class Decorators
Shows how class decorators can be used to modify the behavior of a class.

18.Property Decorators: @property, @setter, and @deleter
Demonstrates the use of property decorators to manage private variables in a class.

19.callable() and call()
Explores the use of the __call__() method to make an object callable like a function.

20.Creating a Custom Exception
Demonstrates how to create a custom exception and handle it using try and except.

21.Make a Custom Class Iterable
Shows how to make a custom class iterable by implementing the __iter__() and __next__() methods.
